The structure is a triumphal arch made of basalt, which is 26 metres high. After its construction the gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to British India for important colonial personnel.

Its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. Road distances to London are traditionally measured from a central point at Charing Cross, which is marked by the statue of King Charles I at the junction of the Strand, Whitehall and Cockspur Street, just south of Trafalgar Square.'),

(197, 'Hampstead Heath', 9, 6, 'Hampstead Heath is a large, ancient London heath, covering 320 hectares.

The south-east part of the heath is Parliament Hill, from which the view over London is protected by law. Running along its eastern perimeter is a chain of ponds &ndash; including three open-air public swimming pools &ndash; which were originally reservoirs for drinking water from the River Fleet. The heath is a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation, and part of Kenwood is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Lakeside concerts are held there in summer.

It is the fourth-most popular visitor attraction in London, attracting approximately 250,000 people each week. A small local foodstuffs market has operated in Inverness Street in Camden Town since the beginning of the 20th century. On 30 March 1974 a small weekly crafts market that operated every Sunday near Camden Lock developed into a large complex of markets. The markets, originally temporary stalls only, extended to a mixture of stalls and fixed premises. The traditional Inverness Street market started losing stalls once local supermarkets opened; by mid-2013 all the original stalls had gone, being replaced by stalls similar to those of the other markets, including fast food but not produce. The markets originally operated on Sundays only, which continues to be the main trading day.'),
(199, 'Green Park', 9, 7, 'The Green Park, usually known without the definite article simply as Green Park, is one of the Royal Parks of London.

It is north of the gardens and the semi-circular forecourt of Buckingham Palace.
